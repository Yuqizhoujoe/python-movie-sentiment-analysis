Charles Koplinski	fresh	Illinois Times	Director James Mangold is at the top of his game, keeping a sure hand on what could have been a sprawling, ungainly narrative, keeping his focus on the two mavericks at the film's center, never letting the viewer forget that the human element of the tale.

Bennett Campbell Ferguson	fresh	Willamette Week	Ford v Ferrari is one of Mangold's most entertaining films-and that's saying something, since he directed Cop Land and Walk the Line-but it should have spent more time exploring the hubris under the hood.	November 14, 2019

Sandra Hall	fresh	Sydney Morning Herald	This is certainly not a film for our times. Drawn from recent history, it's a nostalgic celebration of gas-guzzling fast cars and the people who risked their lives racing them. Yet it's wholly seductive.	November 13, 2019
Larushka Ivan-Zadeh	fresh	Metro (UK)	Ironically, for a story about men creating outside the box, it's pretty formulaic. But there's a glorious, old-fashioned sense of nostalgia about this hunk of Americana that suggests director James Mangold grew up on the Herbie movies.	November 13, 2019
Tom Meek	fresh	Cambridge Day	The race scenes and era are recreated impeccably, but "Ford v Ferrari" goes on a bit too long (two and a half hours) for its own good.	November 13, 2019

Jim Slotek	fresh	Original Cin	For all the formulas it rides on, it passes and laps the one key test of any car movie. It fairly puts you inside cars making hairpin turns at 200 mph. And it brings that sense of metal-mangled death being a split-second away.	November 12, 2019

Nick De Semlyen	fresh	Empire Magazine	A mid-1960s corporate rivalry may not seem like the stuff of fist-pumping, crowd-pleasing cinema, yet the battle is sketched with such lan, all high-gloss surfaces, scotch-swilling intrigue and rat-a-tat dialogue, that it's impossible not to be drawn in.

Erin Carson	fresh	CNET	Where Get Out was a tidy concept that deliberately and carefully guided you through the story toward the big ideas, Us is bigger, broader and perhaps less neat.	May 29, 2019
Jonathan Hatfull	fresh	SciFiNow	For all the immediate fairground ride fun it offers, much of the real pleasure to be had with Us will come from the discussions you'll have afterwards and it certainly demands another viewing.	May 28, 2019

Joseph Earp	fresh	Junkee	Us has no clear answers as to how one might fix such inequality. It's a horror movie, and so like many horror movies, it positions the viewers emotionally closer to the victims than those committing acts of violence against them.	April 4, 2019

Dann Gire	fresh	Chicago Daily Herald	The most frightening element has less to do with its operatic violence than its stunner suggestion as to who the film's true villains might be. It's a double delight.	March 29, 2019
Rashid Irani	fresh	Hindustan Times	This psychological horror-thriller will haunts you long after it's over.	March 29, 2019
Dominic Corry	fresh	New Zealand Herald	Jordan Peele returns with this eagerly anticipated follow-up. The superlative entertainment value proves that his first film wasn't a fluke, but Us is definitely much more of a head-scratcher than Get Out.	March 29, 2019

Christopher Machell	fresh	CineVue	If the number one rule in horror is to never show the monster, Peele gleefully breaks it, forcing his characters and his audience us to gaze directly into its face. Perhaps what is most terrifying is the humanity that stares back.	March 29, 2019
Armond White	rotten	National Review	Interpreting Peele's silliness doesn't go beyond his trivializing black American deprivation into junk-movie entertainment. And no intelligent moviegoer should be impressed by his tonier affectations, which are mere sketch comedy.	March 29, 2019
Alex Doenau	fresh	Trespass	Either viewing it on a surface level or tunnelling deep into its mythos, Us is a richly composed film that succeeds on every level. Even its more contentious elements are still a sign of the victory that Peele exerts over the cinema-goer.	March 29, 2019
Melissa Anderson	fresh	4Columns	Peele seems to lay bare the tremendous anxiety among the members of this family to maintain "respectability," that odious burden so essential to racism's armature.	March 29, 2019
Kevin Harley	fresh	Total Film	Peele doubles down on his genre love with a flawed but full-bore frightener, ripe for debate. Nyong'o is incendiary.	March 29, 2019
Alistair Harkness	fresh	Scotsman	Peele has remarkable command of his visuals, there are some smart jokes dotted throughout, and the ideas he's exploring - the dangers of moral absolutism, the complacency of comfort, the fear of others - are timely and thought-provoking.	March 29, 2019
Rohan Naahar	fresh	Hindustan Times	It's part home invasion thriller, part body swap drama, part Ira Levin-esque psychological satire. Peele's second film is a bolder artistic statement than Get Out, and one of the finest examples of untethered (forgive the pun) studio filmmaking.	March 29, 2019
Frank Ochieng	fresh	SF Crowsnest	The structured anxieties and tampering of normality, gives 'Us' its distinctive realm of descriptive cynicism and shock. Fittingly, Peele's pet project brings a whole new definition to courting face-to-face double trouble.	March 28, 2019
Jourdain Searles	fresh	Bitch Media	The real genius at work in Us is Nyong'o, who anchors the story with underlying rage as well as the protective qualities usually reserved for male leads.	March 28, 2019
Edward Johnson-Ott	rotten	NUVO Newsweekly	Get Out was brilliant, one of the finest movies of this decade, and I've been a fan of Key and Peele for a long time. But not every album is Revolver.	March 28, 2019

Vincent Mancini	fresh	FilmDrunk	In Get Out, Jordan Peele used the promise of genre to deliver social satire. In Us, he uses the promise of social satire to deliver genre. It's a hell of a neat trick.	March 27, 2019
Abby Olcese	fresh	Rave Reviews	Comparisons to Get Out, while inevitable, are ultimately unfair, since Us isn't trying to hit that point. It's just a very entertaining horror movie with some interesting ideas under the hood, and that still counts for a lot.	March 27, 2019
Aisha Jordan	fresh	Black Nerd Problems	A masterfully layered thriller in which the intricate details of each scene build the story and complicate the narrative at every turn.	March 27, 2019

Cameron Williams	fresh	The Popcorn Junkie	A terrifying look at how American society justifies and compartmentalises the horrors of its foundations, the extremes of privilege and the bloody means to protect a patch of sunshine.	March 26, 2019
K. Austin Collins	fresh	Vanity Fair	The joy of it, what makes the film a severe accomplishment, is that it can be a fun ride no matter how overstuffed. But only if, ignoring the film's prompts to mean more, you let it.	March 26, 2019

Aine O'Connor	fresh	Sunday Independent (Ireland)	It is still seriously above average for a horror, Nyong'o is a fabulous lead and the casual race and gender inversions are great. It's a film best experienced rather than overthought.	March 25, 2019
Beatrice Loayza	fresh	MUBI	While Peele's latest still betrays the inclinations of an "early work," there is something undeniably triumphant about the film's individuality, its ability to glean from a mostly underused strain of American culture to ingenious results.	March 25, 2019
Matthew Bond	fresh	The Mail on Sunday (UK)	While it's undoubtedly high time we saw more black leading characters in mainstream horror films -- and Lupita Nyong'o makes a good kick-ass mum here -- I remain unconvinced that he's really reinventing the wheel.	March 25, 2019
Jonathan Dean	fresh	Sunday Times (UK)	Taken as a whole, though, Us is anything but indifferent. It is a rare film that is both tabloid and broadsheet in its mix of celebrity...and existentialism.	March 25, 2019
Michael Medved	fresh	The Michael Medved Show	What starts out as creepy and spell-binding deteriorates into a silly, generic zombie movie before it's partially redeemed by an unforgettably shocking ending.	March 25, 2019
Peter Rainer	fresh	Christian Science Monitor	Ambition in the horror genre can be a good thing, but the overreach in this movie detracts from both the horror and the ambition. Having said that, Peele shows a marked advance in filmmaking skills here and, in her dual role, Nyong'o is ferociously good.	March 25, 2019
Alex Gordon	fresh	Pittsburgh City Paper	And though expected, the film is also incredibly funny and warm.	March 25, 2019
Vicky Roach	fresh	Daily Telegraph (Australia)	Nyong'o's dual performance is nothing short of mesmerising. And she is well supported by Moss's self-involved rich bitch. Sensationally spooky.	March 25, 2019
Terence Johnson	fresh	Le Noir Auteur	Peele's sense of balance as a filmmaker is on display for much of this movie, blending incredible shots and truly laugh out loud moments with ease. That is, until he needs to find a way to end the film and tie together his cavalcade of ideas.	March 25, 2019
Alison Rowat	fresh	The Herald (Scotland)	While Peele's script is laboriously specific about the back stories of the lead characters, he is frustratingly ambiguous when it comes to burnishing the nuts and bolts of the social commentary underpinning the slaughter.	March 25, 2019
Richard von Busack	fresh	MetroActive	Home invasion terror isn't always elegant, but it's always effective. Peele is a genial shocker. Unlike most doorbusters, these hell creatures aren't interested in sex. Comic relief settles in between never-too-horrible mayhem.	March 25, 2019
Mara Fernanda Mugica	fresh	La Nacin (Argentina)	The best thing about Us is not that thematic ambition, but its aesthetic grandiloquence, its disturbing climates and the way in which it abandons realism until it is forgotten. [Full Review in Spanish]	March 25, 2019
Ronda Racha Penrice	fresh	Uptown Magazine	Even if Us lacks Get Out's cohesive vision, it does add an undeniable freshness and innovation to the genre. With Us, Peele proves that he intends to stretch the horror lens primarily by diversifying it.	March 25, 2019

Kate Gardner	fresh	The Mary Sue	Us is brilliant. Frightening in some parts, funny in others, and altogether a cinematic experience.	March 25, 2019
Matt Ward	fresh	Cinematic Considerations	Us is the thinking man's thriller, a film where Peele will point audiences in a direction and then push them to interpret the narrative of Us in their own way.	March 25, 2019
Ciara Dolan	fresh	The Stranger (Seattle, WA)	Maybe Us is overstuffed, or maybe a second viewing could cast further light on these connections. Either way, Us still made me afraid to look in the mirror-the hallmark of an excellent horror movie.	March 25, 2019
Lauren Veneziani	fresh	WBAL-TV	An eerie, fascinating and astounding look at what it truly means when someone says "You are your own worst enemy." Us is that and more and only improves on multiple viewings.	March 25, 2019
Michael Smith	fresh	Tulsa World	I understand why Peele wants us questioning, and talking, and perhaps looking inward. And why he wants us to be afraid. That's what he expects of "Us."	March 25, 2019

Matt Looker	fresh	TheShiznit.co.uk	This is the stuff that makes for truly indelible horror.	March 25, 2019
Daniel M. Kimmel	fresh	New England Movies Weekly	Us may be flawed, but it's well worth seeing. Indeed, if this had been Peele's first film, we'd be proclaiming him a talent to watch.	March 25, 2019
Cameron Frew	fresh	FrewFilm	A sharp, sophomore thrill ride that lingers long after like a shadow.	March 24, 2019

Nate Adams	fresh	The Only Critic	The final shot in Jordan Peele's astounding 'Us' proves that were currently living among one of the best horror directors of this century. Ten years from now we'll be sitting around a campfire discussing which Peele film is our favorite.	March 24, 2019
Matthew Norman	fresh	London Evening Standard	This film, unlike its predecessor, isn't perfect. But it is a richly intriguing riot of imagery and ideas that demands to be rewatched again and again.	March 24, 2019
Mark Kermode	fresh	Observer (UK)	Fearsomely entertaining, consistently thought-provoking and occasionally bloody scary.	March 24, 2019
Kevin A. Ranson	fresh	MovieCrypt.com	... a sinister symphony of symbolism... everything is on the screen and well-acted, but thinking back to where it all began after it's been seen is a true joy.	March 24, 2019
Ray Pride	fresh	Newcity	His horror hullabaloo, his succession of knowing campfire stories, the madly metaphorical, darkly funny, insidious dream-logic nightmare... is described by co-producer Sean McKittrick as "an R-rated Amblin film,"	March 23, 2019
Avi Offer	rotten	NYC Movie Guru	It bites off much more than it could chew with a story that's concurrently overstuffed and undercooked. Peele treats the audience as if they were stupid while hitting them over the head with symbolism and foreshadowing.	March 23, 2019
Ed Whitfield	fresh	The Ooh Tray	An intriguing and uncanny attack on America's divided self.	March 23, 2019

Tim Cogshell	fresh	CineGods.com	Us is a horror movie that poses a couple of simple questions; "Who are we?" and "How can we be sure, who we are?" Questions about which Peele speculates, wildly.	March 23, 2019
Shaun Munro	fresh	Flickering Myth	If markedly less persuasive than Jordan Peele's mesmerising debut, Us nevertheless beguiles with its entrancing mystery and remarkable performances.	March 23, 2019

Kat Hughes	fresh	THN	A strong follow-up to Get Out, with Us, Jordan Peele outs himself as a loud and proud fan of genre cinema, and proves that he's more than capable of frightening the life out of an audience.	March 23, 2019
Wendy Shreve	fresh	Featuring Film	Frightening as a cautionary tale about human arrogance; unnerving in its doomsday references, Us invites us to walk through the glass darkly.	March 23, 2019
Rubin Safaya	rotten	Cinemalogue	I'm not sure I always care whether a horror film explains why God forsakes the soon-to-be-zombie-food inhabitants, but here it becomes a problem precisely because Peele's film brims with possibilities and metaphors left unexplored.	March 23, 2019

Reginald Ponder	fresh	vocalo.org	US is another Jordan Peele film with some important messages wrapped in horror and gore. If you don't leave fearing yourself you will leave knowing that the worst gang is a doppelgng. Deliberate, Disturbing, Deserving.	March 23, 2019
Kristian Harloff	fresh	Schmoes Know	Peele is trying to do something else...was it better than Get Out? I didn't think so. But he doesn't have to do the same movie every time...	March 22, 2019
Chris Stuckmann	fresh	ChrisStuckmann.com	I wish it was a little more ambiguous. Other than that, an extremely well-made horror movie. Jordan Peele, if you want to continue in this genre, please do, it needs you.	March 22, 2019
Steph Cozza	fresh	Aggressive Comix	Nearly perfect. So much fun. A horror movie that I will 100 percent watch again.	March 22, 2019
Donovan Farley	fresh	Willamette Week	As good as these performances are, Us is undoubtedly a film carried by its female characters and the brilliant actresses playing them.	March 22, 2019
Carrie Rickey	fresh	Truthdig	Alas, the exquisite tension of its opening scenes slackens by the payoff. Still, long after the film's closing credits, the social criticism Peele infuses in Us continues to haunt.	March 22, 2019
Soraya Nadia McDonald	fresh	The Undefeated	As social commentary, it's not as razor-sharp as Get Out. But it still feels like an exceptional accomplishment, mainly because Peele created a role that is a worthy showcase of Nyong'o's talent.	March 22, 2019
Linda and Al Lerner	fresh	Movies and Shakers	Peele wanted to pay homage to the traditional horror movie genre but just had to include his brand of comedy. It works and the film is good.	March 22, 2019
Amy Taubin	fresh	Artforum	Peele's script and direction are very smart... but make no mistake, Nyong'o, who can be at once precise and volcanic, holds the film together and takes it to another level of emotional complexity and power.	March 22, 2019
Robert Levin	fresh	amNewYork	For all the ideas Peele nods toward, and all the moments of genuine suspense in a classical sense, it all comes back to Nyong'o.	March 22, 2019

Andrea Thompson	fresh	A Reel of One's Own	Peele's miss is a lot more enjoyable than most hits, but Us still ends up being a concept in service of blood, not the other way around.	March 22, 2019
Andrea Chase	fresh	Killer Movie Reviews	The idea of twinned bodies with share souls, the one at the mercy of the unwitting other, is a proposition into which much can, and should, be read. The overlay of a stunning tale of horror is the opposite of a distraction. It is the point.	March 22, 2019
Abbie Bernstein	fresh	Assignment X	It's a movie that invites engagement beyond its running time, designed to spark debate, analysis, and fear of mirrors. Ultimately, US could be clearer, but it's so awesome on so many levels that this doesn't really matter.	March 22, 2019
Louise Keller	fresh	Urban Cinefile	In an audacious conceit, director Jordan Peele has concocted a humdinger of a tale that is intense, scary, funny and thought provoking in equal measures.	March 22, 2019

Phil Villarreal	fresh	ABC Tucson	This iw a water cooler-worthy experience.	March 22, 2019
Tom Meek	fresh	Cambridge Day	Us is best seen as a straight-up chiller that's well crafted and fantastically acted.	March 22, 2019
George Thomas	fresh	Akron Beacon Journal	What's refreshing about Peele's first two efforts - Get Out being his first - is he doesn't rely on gratuitous violence to provide his thrills.	March 22, 2019
Pete Hammond	fresh	Deadline Hollywood Daily	Jordan Peele's return to horror is intriguing but no 'Get Out'.	March 22, 2019
Adam Nayman	fresh	The Ringer	Ideally, watching Us, we'd see ourselves, and some viewers may well have those moments of recognition. What I see is a talented guy going for broke and, for better and for worse, getting there.	March 22, 2019
Miles Surrey	fresh	The Ringer	The movie is downright scary, a doppelganger nightmare that also provides the best reason in recent memory for why one ought to avoid funhouses...it begs further analysis and conversation.	March 22, 2019
Matt Rodriguez	fresh	Shakefire	Us is another uniquely terrifying masterpiece from Jordan Peele and further cements him as an auteur of Hollywood.	March 22, 2019
Mark Kermode	fresh	Kermode & Mayo's Film Review	The second time around... I was much more impressed by the interweaving, by the textures.	March 22, 2019
David Stratton	fresh	The Australian	Even if his screenplay has flaws, Us confirms that Peele is an accomplished director with a wicked sense of humour.	March 22, 2019
Annlee Ellingson	fresh	L.A. Biz	[Jordan Peele's] follow-up Us offers more trenchant commentary embedded in horror-movie tropes. His message this time, though, is more mysterious -- and insidious.	March 22, 2019
Jennifer Heaton	fresh	Alternative Lens	Us is another refreshing and well-crafted Jordan Peele horror flick, but in swapping out Get Out's clear motives for a more esoteric experience it lands on uneven territory.	March 22, 2019
Sarah Cullen	fresh	Film Ireland Magazine	Lupita Nyong'o is fantastic.	March 22, 2019
Katie Walsh	fresh	Tribune News Service	It wouldn't be as truly terrifying as it is without the jaw-dropping performance from his leading lady, Nyong'o, and with this collaboration they have created another whip-smart modern horror classic.	March 22, 2019
James Verniere	fresh	Boston Herald	Not as politically explosive as Get Out, Us has plenty of scares and fun. Lupita Nyong'o and Wilson Duke are terrific as are the kids.	March 22, 2019
Molly Laich	fresh	doghatesfilm.com	The movie's not as tight as Get Out, but that's a hard act to follow, and at the very least, Us is definitely more scary.	March 22, 2019
Sara Michelle Fetters	fresh	MovieFreak.com	Peele orchestrates events with marvelous confidence, his ability to fill every corner of the frame with a sense of foreboding uncertainty not to be taken lightly or casually dismissed.	March 22, 2019
Joey Magidson	fresh	Hollywood News	Can a film be way overpraised and also be rather terrific? In this case, that's what I found Us to be. Despite not sticking the landing, Peele shows he's a new genre master.	March 22, 2019
Michael Ward	fresh	Should I See It	Us is brave, bold, crazy, and compelling, featuring an astonishing performance by Lupita Nyong'o.	March 22, 2019
Leonard Maltin	rotten	leonardmaltin.com	When 'Us' was over I didn't feel a sense of satisfaction. Perhaps that's because Peele packed more into his dense screenplay than was absolutely necessary. It's self-consciously clever, and strictly on a gut level, the movie left me wanting	March 22, 2019
Kelly Vance	fresh	East Bay Express	Drop whatever you're doing and run to see Us. You might recognize someone you already know.	March 22, 2019
Martin Thomas	fresh	Double Toasted	Story-wise, I wouldn't necessarily seek it out again. But just to watch how it constructed, it's worth several viewings.	March 22, 2019
Korey Coleman	fresh	Double Toasted	It's a very well done, not just horror movie, but a very well directed movie... it actually works as a good action film too.	March 22, 2019
Bill Watters	fresh	Bleeding Cool	Jorden Peele has appeared on the scene as a master of atmospheric dread and terror, and it's that skill that saves 'Us' from a week (even by horror standards) storyline.	March 22, 2019
Jim Judy	fresh	Screen It!	Peele handles the creepy stuff with aplomb, but doesn't forget his comedy roots and occasionally throws in a funny bit here and there. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, Profanity, etc. - also Available)	March 22, 2019

Scott Wampler	fresh	Birth.Movies.Death.	Us is an absolute feast for horror fans, a film we're gonna spend the next two years dissecting and decoding.	March 22, 2019
Chauncey K. Robinson	fresh	People's World	The ambitious film leaves a great deal of mystery in its wake (for better or worse), while aiming high with a fresh take on horror.	March 22, 2019
Jeffrey M. Anderson	fresh	San Francisco Examiner	Some may compare "Us" to "Get Out" and find it wanting, but others will realize no measuring is necessary. "Us" is very simply a tense, startling, and wildly entertaining, movie.	March 22, 2019
Victor Stiff	fresh	In The Seats	Us is a terrifying thriller that is wickedly funny and jam-packed with striking visuals.	March 22, 2019
Matthew Lickona	rotten	San Diego Reader	The result is bloody but weirdly bloodless, a sort of thinky exercise in horror filmmaking. There's more juice in the laughs here than the scares.	March 22, 2019
Matthew Sorrento	fresh	Film International	The film is an economic nightmare machine, once it gets going. Serving both worlds of fans, the terrors are eerie and bone-crunching... in the same brisk rhythm as Get Out.	March 22, 2019
Hazel Cills	fresh	The Muse/Jezebel	While Us may be marred with flaws, the family at its center can probably withstand anything.	March 22, 2019
Princess Weekes	fresh	The Mary Sue	To say that Us is more than a horror movie does a disservice to the genre that Peele loves. Us is a horror movie in all the glory that encompasses.	March 22, 2019
Josephine Livingstone	fresh	The New Republic	Us is an uncanny movie, and an implicit riposte to the questions Peele himself asked in Get Out. What if there's no easy ending? What if the real struggle takes place within?	March 22, 2019
Deirdre Crimmins	fresh	HighDef Digest	Nyong'o defies comparison to other horror heroines since she pulls double duty as both victim and monster. I cannot recall the last time an actor made my skin crawl for the entire length of her introduction, and every single moment on screen thereafter.	March 22, 2019
Alan Jones	fresh	Radio Times	While the socio-political allegory feels a little clunky this time... it's still a weird and wild ride down the rabbit hole, impressively juggling comedy and horror to hugely entertaining effect.	March 22, 2019
Fico Cangiano	fresh	CineXpress	An excellent follow-up for director/writer Jordan Peele. Ambitious, relevant and disturbing, Us is horror done really, really well. [Full review in Spanish]	March 22, 2019
Dom Sinacola	fresh	Paste Magazine	If Get Out introduced a savvy culture vulture to a moviegoing public starving for original voices and underrepresented perspectives, then Us shapes that introduction with exacting intimacy and humor and a lot of blood.	March 22, 2019
Alci Rengifo	fresh	Entertainment Voice	"Us" is a worthy heir to a great and fun tradition in cinema, where the scares are very bloody, but it's what they're actually about that counts. Fair warning, do not go see this movie if you absolutely do not like to have your heart rate quicken.	March 22, 2019
Esther Zuckerman	fresh	Thrillist	Much of Us feels like an excavation, and maybe even an exorcism, of Peele's childhood influences, all in an effort to make a grand metaphor about the callousness of America and its class system.	March 22, 2019
Piers Marchant	fresh	Arkansas Democrat-Gazette	I'm happy to report [Jordan] Peele has done nothing here to suggest his debut was a lucky flash in the pan. This film continues his uncanny understanding of human interaction, and his flare for visual audaciousness.	March 22, 2019
Pamela Powell	fresh	Reel Honest Reviews	"Us" showcases Peele's seemingly innate ability to perfectly blend comedy and horror with the timing of a Swiss watch. Unfortunately, after the initial set up of the premise, the film becomes an exercise in typical horror gore.	March 22, 2019
Kate Snchez	fresh	But Why Tho? A Geek Community	Us...is both a slow burning unsettling spectacle and a full throttle assault on your heart.	March 22, 2019
Kyle Smith	rotten	National Review	I didn't find any of it particularly engaging despite Peele's nudging us to attach some sociopolitical importance to developments.	March 22, 2019
Gary Wolcott	fresh	Tri-City Herald	Barely recommending this one. Peele's second W/D effort is mostly so-so. It's like fast food. Looks good, tastes good but is so many empty calories.	March 22, 2019
Adam Graham	fresh	Detroit News	"Us" will pin you to your seat and leave you stiff with fear. The mystery it weaves, however, doesn't yield any immediately satisfying answers, only more questions. But at least it gets you thinking, and these days, that's plenty.	March 22, 2019
Bob Chipman	fresh	Escapist Magazine	It could be argued Nyong'o is giving one of, if not the, best female horror lead performances ever, basically having to play both Michael Myers and Laurie Strode at the same time.	March 22, 2019
Caryn James	fresh	BBC.com	The film takes an unexpected, spectacular stylistic turn.	March 22, 2019
Max Weiss	fresh	Baltimore Magazine	Us is much scarier than Get Out, but less funny. Peele occasionally disrupts the tension with a few jokes but he wants to keep you freaked out, not laughing.	March 22, 2019
Kyle Pinion	fresh	The Beat	For those who are willing to meet it on its own terms, you'll find an even more rewarding experience, one catered by Peele's lovely shot compositions and a tremendously frightening double-edged performance by Nyong'o.	March 22, 2019
Dwight Brown	fresh	National Newspaper Publishers Association	Us never reaches that over-the-edge crescendo into total mayhem that scares you to death and makes a good horror film a great one.	March 22, 2019
Josh Terry	fresh	Deseret News (Salt Lake City)	"Us" is an excellent production that stands above much of the routine horror efforts that dot the release calendar, and another interesting step in Peele's evolving entertainment career.	March 22, 2019
John Urbancich	fresh	Your Movies (cleveland.com)	While the whole adventure might flaunt an occasional reach or two, Peele's initial set up, as well as some revelations that follow the sheer terror of that first introduction, show up quite unexpectedly.	March 22, 2019
Christian Toto	fresh	HollywoodInToto.com	No, Get Out wasn't a fluke.	March 22, 2019
Lisa Johnson Mandell	rotten	AtHomeInHollywood.com	It has some masterful cinematic bites, but when you step back and take a look at it as a whole, there are too many random pieces stitched together that don't quite fit.	March 22, 2019
Matthew Rozsa	fresh	Salon.com	But the good so greatly outweighs the bad; "Us" is definitely worth seeing, and it is a positive sign for the quality of Peele's upcoming "Twilight Zone" reboot.	March 22, 2019
Johnny Gayzmonic	fresh	Fanboys of the Universe	As challenging as it is mysterious, it leaves us with more questions than answers, and in that darkness and doubt, it finds the true meaning of terror.	March 22, 2019

Sonny Bunch	fresh	Washington Free Beacon	Tim Heidecker ... is the film's low-key MVP.	March 22, 2019
Anthony Lane	fresh	New Yorker	"Us" is political filmmaking of the most spirited sort, and it sets up quite a fight: the Hydes come to visit the Jekylls, and the Jekylls hit back. Whom you cheer for, in the long run, is up to you.	March 22, 2019
Kurt Loder	fresh	Reason Online	Very scary. And Peele's uber-nerd cinephilia is non-stop fun ("Isn't that the Lost Boys boardwalk?"). But as a writer, he has more ideas than he can fit into one picture, and even his great gifts as a director can't stanch the conceptual overflow.	March 22, 2019
Kate Muir	fresh	Daily Mail (UK)	Us takes us on a deeply weird journey into the conflicted heart of America, but it begins in traditional horror-movie territory.	March 22, 2019
Steve Crum	fresh	Video-Reviewmaster.com	You know a movie is really scary when audience members at the preview keep yelling at the screen, "Don't open that door!" and "Look out!" (I didn't say such, but I sure thought it.)	March 22, 2019
Chris Feil	fresh	The Film Experience	Us satisfies immensely in part because Peele is as concerned with developing Adelaide's inner tension as he is in molding specific family dynamics.	March 22, 2019
Bill Arceneaux	fresh	Big Easy Magazine	Seriously, Us is an instant classic from an instant player.	March 22, 2019

Rene Sanchez	fresh	Cine Sin Fronteras	Lupita Nyong'o's powerhouse performance finds its equal in Jordan Peele's masterful storytelling. A horror tale that confronts us with the social problems that lie beneath the surface. [Full Review in Spanish]	March 22, 2019
Emmanuel Noisette	fresh	The Movie Blog	A freshly unique homage to classic horror films with a splash of social commentary. Sadly, the expectations for "Us" will be "tethered down" by the success of "Get Out".	March 22, 2019
Robert Horton	fresh	HeraldNet (Everett, WA)	Maybe it's inevitable that Peele's second film as writer-director doesn't light up the sky in the same way -- but at least it throws off plenty of sparks.	March 22, 2019

Mario Alegre	fresh	Prxima Tanda	Jordan Peele's highly entertaining -albeit, a bit muddled- follow-up to Get Out, gives us, not one, but two of Lupita Nyong'o's best performances in (incredibly) her first leading role.	March 22, 2019

Paul Whitington	fresh	Irish Independent	Us is great fun, and very funny, and uses a banging soundtrack to very skillful effect. It also looks great.	March 21, 2019
Kevin Maher	fresh	Times (UK)	The film, ultimately, is about spills and thrills, masterfully executed. It will, however, leave you with the nagging feeling that the many messages and meanings haven't quite yet coalesced into a watertight narrative concept.	March 21, 2019

Dana Barbuto	fresh	The Patriot Ledger	Blame Jordan Peele if you're unable to sleep peacefully again.	March 21, 2019
Steve Erickson	fresh	Gay City News	Peele knows how to make a straightforward horror film. The middle section of Us uses jump scares and sudden stabs of music. But it's closer to Michael Haneke's Funny Games than Jaws, despite the T-shirt Jason wears.	March 21, 2019
Beth Accomando	fresh	KPBS.org	Jordan Peele's Us serves up a very different kind of horror from his debut feature "Get Out," but it is scary good in its own way.	March 21, 2019

Peter Howell	fresh	Toronto Star	The film relies on the brilliant-times-two acting of Nyong'o, who slips between protective mom and devilish double with a facility that keeps everybody on edge, both on and off the screen.	March 21, 2019
Lynnette Nicholas	fresh	Black Girl Nerds	In Peele's Us, there is truly no place to run and hide. The only solution is for the families affected by these evil appearances to truly look inside of themselves.	March 21, 2019
Pablo O. Scholz	fresh	Clarn	[Jordan Peele] operates the intrigue with a firm hand, although when the story begins to veer towards the fantastic/apocalyptic it can't surpass the cliches of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]	March 21, 2019
Norman Wilner	fresh	NOW Toronto	It may not feel as revolutionary as Get Out, but the director's follow-up to his Oscar-winning debut is sharp, smart and artful.	March 21, 2019
Randy Shulman	fresh	Metro Weekly (Washington, DC)	Jordan Peele has more on his mind than to merely offer up a scary ride. He wants audiences engaged on every possible level. He wants his horror films to mean something.	March 21, 2019
Alissa Wilkinson	fresh	Vox	It's horrific in a way that hangs onto your gut when it's all over.	March 21, 2019
Taylor Antrim	fresh	Vogue	It's a funhouse of conflicting narratives... insists that you see it seen again.	March 21, 2019
Ty Burr	fresh	Boston Globe	A handful of eek-eek-eek scenes aside, the movie's not so much gory as intensely unnerving, with just enough laughs larded in to remind us we're having a good time.	March 21, 2019
Daniel Nava	fresh	Chicago Cinema Circuit	Us is most persuasive when compressed, when we're observing its concerns through the retina of Nyong'o performance.	March 21, 2019
Travis Hopson	fresh	Punch Drunk Critics	...again Peele is back exploring humanity's ills through the lens of horror, specifically the divide between us that will surely lead to our downfall. Or it's just a home invasion movie with a twist. Take your pick.	March 21, 2019
Ryan Gilbey	fresh	New Statesman	Us represents a definite advance on Get Out, and establishes Peele as a fascinating film-maker. When he learns to stop over-complicating things, he may even become a great one, too.	March 21, 2019
Chris Hewitt	fresh	Minneapolis Star Tribune	We don't get many horror movies with better performances than the ones Lupita Nyong'o and Elisabeth Moss give in "Us."	March 21, 2019

Micheal Compton	fresh	Bowling Green Daily News	"Us" runs the gamut of emotions -- a film that is smart, funny, terrifying and absolutely memorable. It embraces the communal experience of a packed theater quite well.	March 21, 2019
Jeremy Jahns	fresh	JeremyJahns.com	It was intense. That's what Joran Peele understands about thrillers and horror -- they're not just for gore. [He's] telling a story about characters.	March 21, 2019
Sean P. Means	fresh	The Movie Cricket	Peele twists the screws expertly, sometimes goosing us with a solid jump-scare, sometimes relying on the slow burn to instill a sense of dread.	March 21, 2019
Eric Melin	fresh	The Pitch	As you might expect with a horror film about dopplegangers: the terror lies within, we are our own worst enemies, etc. But Peele's allegory goes beyond that into a fable about crippling self-doubt and class struggles.	March 21, 2019
Peter Sobczynski	fresh	eFilmCritic.com	With "Us," Peele shows that he is no mere pretender to someone else's throne, but a unique talent in his own right who will almost certainly be looked upon as a source of inspiration from future generations of filmmakers.	March 21, 2019
Jake Coyle	fresh	Associated Press	While each member of the family excels, Nyong'o delivers arguably her fiercest, most extraordinary performance as both Adelaide and her monstrous doppelganger.	March 21, 2019
Deborah Ross	rotten	The Spectator	I was grateful it wasn't that frightening but not so grateful that it was quite so repetitively dull.	March 21, 2019
Sherin Nicole	fresh	idobi.com	This is a blood soaked fable with white rabbits you can't help but follow down -- and it's a thrilling way to fall. Peele excels at the shocks and reversals Hitchcock and Serling would cheer for. Yet he does it his way, and his way is so very good.	March 21, 2019
Nick Rogers	fresh	Midwest Film Journal	Superbly mounted dread, insistent escalation, elegantly sustained tension - a forest fire to Get Out's slow burn. Us is Jordan Peele's Jurassic Park, where a fear of monsters learning to open doors takes on chilling new meanings.	March 21, 2019
Alexa Dalby	fresh	Dog and Wolf	Us is truly scary - right from the start. It shocks you with sudden thumps, bumps and crashes and lulls you into a false sense of security with tension-relieving deadpan laughs before the next surprise hits you.	March 21, 2019
Walter Chaw	rotten	Film Freak Central	Honestly, Us is so scattershot and confused, I'm not sure the quote represents anything beyond its chapter/verse doubling.	March 21, 2019
Carl Kozlowski	rotten	Pasadena Weekly	This is a stunning fall for Peele, who's trying to make a commentary about our light and dark sides, as well as class warfare, but it has none of the punch and effectiveness of "Get Out."	March 21, 2019
Leslie Combemale	fresh	Cinema Siren	Lupita Nyong'o's exquisite blend of nuance and scenery-chewing as Adelaide and Red deserves to be listed among the best horror performances ever.	March 21, 2019
Hope Madden	fresh	Columbus Underground	Peele draws on moods and images from horror's collective unconscious and blends them into something hypnotic and almost primal.	March 21, 2019
Kristen Lopez	fresh	Culturess	While it doesn't nail down the climax, Us is a highly unpredictable, unique, and haunting horror feature that tethers itself to you.	March 21, 2019
Andrew Parker	fresh	The Gate	Like the best horror movies, Us chillingly lingers with dread long after the credits have rolled, and like the smartest and most entertaining films, it's something I wanted to watch again the second it ended.	March 21, 2019
Neil Pond	fresh	Parade Magazine	A modern horror movie that has the feel of an instant classic, one that has staying power to shock and awe years or even decades from now.	March 21, 2019

Jim Slotek	fresh	Original Cin	Ambitious, ambiguous and chilling in ways most of us probably never even imagined.	March 21, 2019
Sandy Schaefer	fresh	ScreenRant	Us manages to be funny, freaky, and thrilling all at once, and marks another step forward in Peele's evolving sense of storytelling and craftsmanship.	March 21, 2019
Laura Clifford	rotten	Reeling Reviews	this satire of the American dream, where those who get left behind simmer in murderous resentment, resembles one of those unwieldy Stephen King novels like "The Tommyknockers" or "Insomnia" where a good concept unravels and goes off the rails.	March 21, 2019
Michael Phillips	fresh	Chicago Tribune	Peele, who came out of sketch and improv comedy and retains his wit even when he's frying our nerves, has made his second fascinating thriller, this one closer to full-on and wonderfully suggestive horror.	March 21, 2019
Maren Longbella	fresh	St. Paul Pioneer Press	"Us" exceeds all expectations and then some.	March 21, 2019
Kambole Campbell	fresh	Little White Lies	A viscerally terrifying and often hilarious thrill-ride, even if the seams begin to show in the final act.	March 21, 2019
Brian Roan	fresh	The Film Stage	Among many the questions that Us may raise in an audience, the foremost might be this: is being no more than the sum of its parts a bad thing if so many of those parts are really, really fun?	March 21, 2019
Robbie Collin	fresh	Daily Telegraph (UK)	The showpiece scares in Us are the opposite of ordinary horror jolts: its big shocks dawn slow, and they don't recede.	March 21, 2019
Gary Thompson	fresh	Philadelphia Daily News	Us, next to Peele's directorial debut Get Out, can be more comfortably tucked into the horror genre, but it's just as ambitious, and eager to function as social commentary.	March 21, 2019

Tim Grierson	fresh	Screen International	Perhaps "Us" stumbles near the end while straining for an operatic, shattering finale. But after capturing the zeitgeist his first time out, Jordan Peele avoids the sophomore slump by methodically laying out his riveting tale.	March 21, 2019
Brian Orndorf	fresh	Blu-ray.com	More technically adventurous than Peele's debut, showcasing encouraging cinematic development diminished by a few iffy filmmaking habits.	March 21, 2019

Jordan Ruimy	fresh	World of Reel	After a thrilling 100 minutes, Peele's ambitions do get the best of him - he can't quite close it out and the film's messy final 15 minutes feel overtly expository. Alas, it turns out that "Us," quite ironically, is also confused about its own identity.	March 21, 2019

Henry Stewart	fresh	Slant Magazine	Jordan Peele's follow-up to Get Out unnervingly speaks to the issues affecting a divided nation.	March 20, 2019
Mick LaSalle	fresh	San Francisco Chronicle	Last time, Peele made a movie about the country. This time he made a movie about himself, and it's even better.	March 20, 2019
Moira MacDonald	fresh	Seattle Times	While the movie doesn't entirely do justice to its ambitious theme - it gets a little stuck in chase-and-attack mode for too long, and its final scenes are a bit opaque - it's always surprising and completely gripping.	March 20, 2019
Dan Murrell	fresh	Screen Junkies	This cements Jordan Peele as one of the most exciting and talented filmmakers working today.	March 20, 2019
Cary Darling	fresh	Houston Chronicle	The chills in "Us" don't come from the gory and the gruesome but, as in Peele's "Get Out," from his playing with the notion that the scariest moments come from inside us.	March 20, 2019
Jeff Beck	rotten	The Blu Spot	"Us" is the kind of movie that, while you can admire the craft and skill that went into it, will leave you scratching your head as to how Peele thought any of it was plausible.	March 20, 2019

Joe Friar	fresh	The Victoria Advocate	A heart-pounding excursion down horror's darkest corridors with the brilliant Lupita Nyong'o as the driving force. The film moves at such ferocity that you won't be able to catch your breath until the credits roll.	March 20, 2019
Richard Roeper	fresh	Chicago Sun-Times	This is an unforgettable dance with the devil.	March 20, 2019
John Lui	fresh	The Straits Times (Singapore)	Peele once more shows that he is a better writer than director. This work spills over with themes and symbols, just not coherently arranged, nor presented in a visually stylish way.	March 20, 2019
Greg Maki	fresh	Star-Democrat (Easton, MD)	With minimal gore, Peele prefers to get inside his viewers' heads. Scaring you is the first thing he wants to do, but he'll ask you to think while he's there, too.	March 20, 2019
Jonathan W. Hickman	fresh	Daily Film Fix	Unconventional and mysterious, "Us" takes viewers on a bloody and murderous ride through the eyes of the survivors. And Peele smartly makes us survivors all, condemning us, like the WIlsons, to grapple with all the nagging questions.	March 20, 2019

Peter Travers	fresh	Rolling Stone	Nyong'o delivers one of the great performances in horror movie history, as Jordan Peele shows us a world tragically untethered to its own humanity, its empathy, its soul. If that's not a scarefest for its time, I don't know what is.	March 20, 2019

Charles Pulliam-Moore	fresh	io9.com	Black Panther would not have been as strong a movie if it didn't contemplate those heavier concepts, but the film also never misses a beat to be absolutely joyous and reverent about Wakanda's magnificence.	February 16, 2018

Anthony Lane	fresh	New Yorker	Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther.	February 16, 2018
Peter Sobczynski	fresh	eFilmCritic.com	Black Panther is more than good enough and not only does it live up to those sky-high expectations, it pretty much exceeds them.

Peter Rainer	fresh	Christian Science Monitor	Coogler is trying for a lot of things in Black Panther, probably too many, but there is also a winning modesty to his ambition.	February 16, 2018
Max Weiss	fresh	Baltimore Magazine	I loved spending a couple of hours in the Black Panther's magical, transformative world. Mark me down as someone who wants Wakanda to stay isolated.	February 16, 2018
Armond White	rotten	National Review	Black Panther turns racial politics into what Malcolm X called "politricks" . . . The media's enthusiasm for this bland action flick is maddening. The problem isn't one particular movie, but the celebration of the illusion of "progress."	February 16, 2018
Saskia Baron	rotten	The Arts Desk	What's the problem? Well, there's way too much expository dialogue and there are too many turgid flashbacks...the hand-to-hand fighting and battle sequences are now so formulaic and predictable in Marvel films that the adrenaline just doesn't kick in.	February 16, 2018
Brooke Corso	fresh	The Monitor (McAllen, TX)	Black Panther definitely warrants multiple viewings - one just for the visual roller-coaster ride, and sets itself apart from the rest of the MCU with a formidable blend of good story and magnificent design.	February 16, 2018

Liam Lacey	fresh	Original Cin	Nolan's Dunkirk is stripped-down almost to the point of abstraction, a story with little dialogue, focusing on a series of physical terrors - drowning, being struck from above or behind, all endured with tight-lipped masculine resolve.	August 4, 2017
Dave Searle	fresh	NUVO Newsweekly	This movie took [a] piece of family lore and made it viscerally, undeniably real. I'm personally grateful for that.	August 3, 2017

Brooke Corso	fresh	The Monitor (McAllen, TX)	It is a film with little blood and heavy stress and fatigue, easy on combat and heavy on tragedy, as Nolan's obsession with time is made elastic to reflect the perspectives of the soldiers on water, ground, and air.	August 1, 2017

Ray Pride	fresh	Newcity	Elegance of nightmare, essence of terror. We are catapulted to war, in three interleaving but sometimes indistinct timeframes: a week, a day, an hour. Time collapses. There is the presence of fright, the adrenalized now.	July 31, 2017

Robert Roten	fresh	Laramie Movie Scope	It takes a confident, accomplished filmmaker to make a war film like this, epic, understated, nearly bereft of dialog, no off screen narration, a huge story brought down to intimate levels. It reminds me of some Stanley Kubrick movies.	July 26, 2017

Ed Whitfield	fresh	The Ooh Tray	It's a curious mix of old fashioned mawkishness, dewy eyed, if understated, patriotism, and contemporary art house narratological experimentation. It is, appropriately, very British (as we like to think of ourselves).	July 24, 2017

Christopher Lawrence	fresh	Las Vegas Review-Journal	Dunkirk's relatively brief running time, though, means there's rarely a dull moment. Viewers are thrust into the action, and like many of the soldiers, they're left on their own to sink or swim.	July 21, 2017

Sarah Ward	fresh	ArtsHub	A vivid symphony of visceral experiences.	July 21, 2017
Allyson Johnson	fresh	Cambridge Day	With an interwoven script that intersects when you least expect it, the film is a mighty example of storytelling and the power of atmosphere.	July 21, 2017
Rick Bentley	fresh	Tribune News Service	Although Dunkirk looks at one of the most amazing military/civil operations of World War II (or maybe of any military conflict in history), it's not a war movie. It's Christopher Nolan's view of a war movie.	July 21, 2017
Graeme Tuckett	fresh	Stuff.co.nz	Nolan again continues his proud tradition of eschewing computer-generated shots in favour of actual ships, planes and men. The result is a film that will look authentic, bloody, honest and real for as long there are people to watch it.	July 21, 2017
Dave Crewe	fresh	Junkee	Dunkirk isn't striving to immortalise English heroism as a sepia-toned portrait. Dunkirk simply wants to transport you to the battlefield, and experience the horrors that lie there.	July 21, 2017
Deborah Ross	rotten	The Spectator	It is brave, and even admirable, but if you are fond of an emotional core? Then you will sorely feel the lack of it.	July 21, 2017
Michael Smith	fresh	Tulsa World	The miracle of Dunkirk is that it's different from other war movies in the best ways, and it's exceptional in every technical sense, making it one of the most emotionally powerful films of 2017.	July 21, 2017
Sean P. Means	fresh	Salt Lake Tribune	As both a fresh approach to historical action and a thunderous throwback to old-fashioned war movies, Christopher Nolan's "Dunkirk" is a triumphant feat of white-knuckle storytelling.	July 21, 2017
Ryan Gilbey	fresh	New Statesman	The picture is distinguished by a knack for undercutting genre conventions without diminishing them emotionally.	July 21, 2017
Bernard Boo	fresh	PopMatters	Dunkirk is Nolan's most directly cinematic of his works, knocking plot and melodrama down the totem pole in favor of furiously transportive images and sounds that elicit emotion in a more primal, instinctual way.	July 21, 2017
J.R. Kinnard	fresh	PopMatters	Arguably Nolan's best film, Dunkirk is a propulsive descent into Hell that celebrates the indomitable human spirit.	July 21, 2017
Rob Carnevale	fresh	Indie London	A vivid, heart-pounding, emotional rollercoaster of a film, Dunkirk is also one of the most immersive experiences you could ever wish to endure. But therein lies its genius.	July 21, 2017
Tim Evans	fresh	Sky Cinema	Ultimately, this is an unsentimentally masterful chronicle of a propaganda victory plucked from the jaws of military disaster.	July 20, 2017
Liz Braun	fresh	Toronto Sun	The film is a wonder to experience (especially in Imax), but it's not perfect. For all the technical brilliance, there's something emotionally removed about the storytelling that keeps a viewer at arm's length throughout.	July 20, 2017
Burl Burlingame	fresh	Honolulu Star-Advertiser	The pleasure in the storytelling arc is how elements move swiftly together. Nolan's biggest trick is the film starts out being epic and moves effortlessly to the intimate ....	July 20, 2017
Kevin Maher	rotten	Times (UK)	What it is, essentially, is 106 clamorous minutes of big-screen bombast that's so concerned with its own spectacle and scale that it neglects to deliver the most crucial element -- drama.	July 20, 2017
Jason Di Rosso	fresh	The Final Cut	His exciting set pieces of sinking ships and aerial dogfights will thrill audiences who head to big Hollywood films for spectacle. But when Nolan gets the subtler moments right, you see something much more.	July 20, 2017
Jeff Simon	fresh	Buffalo News	So many of us wanted Dunkirk to be truly great. It's too virtuous and not vulgar enough to be great. It's a brilliant film that embraces grandeur but has a tasteful horror of rhetoric.	July 20, 2017

Kenneth Turan	fresh	Los Angeles Times	Both intimate and epic, as emotional as it is tension-filled, it is being ballyhooed as a departure for bravura filmmaker Christopher Nolan, but in truth the reason it succeeds so masterfully is that it is anything but.	July 20, 2017
Leigh Paatsch	fresh	Herald Sun (Australia)	It only takes a matter of minutes for Dunkirk to convey the unmistakeable notion you are in the presence of true cinematic greatness. This is what a masterpiece looks like. Sounds like. Feels like.	July 20, 2017

Kyle Smith	fresh	National Review	As magnificently well crafted as Dunkirk is, it is a film destined to be respected more than it is loved, and given Nolan's record -- I credit him with five great movies -- I call this a highly honorable achievement that nonetheless slightly disappoints.

Jon Niccum	fresh	Kansas City Star	The finest war movies examine the personal struggles within the larger framework of a battle: the eye-level conflict. That's the strategy of "Dunkirk," an ambitious, evocative (but at times too aloof) World War II epic.	July 20, 2017
Marc Savlov	fresh	Austin Chronicle	I'd go so far to say that Dunkirk could easily serve as its own master class in the art of film editing. Add to that an absolutely terrifyingly discordant score from Hans Zimmer and the result is, well, a bona fide classic. Well done, sir, well done.	July 20, 2017

Bob Bloom	fresh	Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)	Wisely, Nolan's movie is not about the "big picture." At about 106 minutes, it's a fast-paced, rousing story of soldiers and civilians confronting overwhelming odds, their moral compasses, fear and the specter of death.	July 20, 2017
Manohla Dargis	fresh	New York Times	"Dunkirk" is a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's.	July 20, 2017

Brian Viner	fresh	Daily Mail (UK)	A roaringly high-octane crime movie reminiscent of the best of Quentin Tarantino.	July 2, 2017
Andy Lea	fresh	Daily Express (UK)	While Wright is a master stylist, I'm still not convinced he is a great storyteller.	July 2, 2017
Mark Kermode	fresh	Observer (UK)	It's when the horns and drums of the Button Down Brass's Tequila become gunfire, or the madness of Hocus Pocus by Focus drives a breathless chase, that Wright really puts his foot down, with exhilarating results.	July 2, 2017
Louise Keller	fresh	Urban Cinefile	Everything has rhythm in Edgar Wright's Baby Driver, starting with its original premise, fresh execution and a soundtrack guaranteed to get pulses racing and feet tapping.	July 2, 2017

Matt Brunson	fresh	Creative Loafing	Between the character dynamics, the vehicular stuntwork, and the carefully chosen soundtrack, Baby Driver clicks on all cylinders -- at least until it hits the homestretch.	July 1, 2017
Brandon Judell	fresh	Huffington Post	Ansel Elgort bops around 'Baby Driver' like 'Saturday Night Fever's Tony Manero, with his ear buds semi-glued in. You keep expecting a few disco balls to pop into view while the Bee Gees let loose on the soundtrack.	July 1, 2017
Gary Wolcott	fresh	Tri-City Herald	Baby Driver is a nice twist on an old car chase, car crash, bullets flying everywhere and hitting everyone but the main characters genre. Fun flick.	July 1, 2017
Ray Pride	fresh	Newcity	Boisterous, crackerjack, bubblegum power-pop, adrenaline-stoking coolly-choreographed manic action, fragrant with delight in its own substantial craft, Edgar Wright's zooming genre riff Baby Driver is an epic car-chase confabulation.	July 1, 2017
Sara Michelle Fetters	fresh	MovieFreak.com	Baby Driver might not live entirely up to the hype, but that doesn't make it any less wonderful, Wright once again showing he's a fearless genre-busting directorial wunderkind who's creative gas tank overflows in originality.	June 30, 2017

Gary Dowell	fresh	Dark Horizons	It works like a charm, especially when Wright's alchemy is applied to some jaw-dropping chase scenes and in-camera car stunts that make the CGI cheating of the "Fast and Furious" franchise look like amateur night.	June 30, 2017
Jeff Simon	fresh	Buffalo News	Go to the movies, sit down, be entertained for 113 minutes, crank up the car radio on the way home - with luck, on a perfectly clear summer night.	June 30, 2017
Kristian M. Lin	fresh	Fort Worth Weekly	The astonishing fluidity with which [Wright] puts together the music, editing, and performances gives Baby Driver the sensation of riding in a high-performance car with just the right song coming over the speakers. The world seems to fall into place.	June 30, 2017
Mike McGranaghan	fresh	Aisle Seat	There are great movies you admire, and then there are great movies you admire that also make you deliriously happy. Baby Driver is the latter.	June 30, 2017
Tom Meek	fresh	Cambridge Day	Besides the chase sequences, what makes Baby Driver go is the hot potpourri of personalities Baby gets paired with.	June 30, 2017

Alan Zilberman	fresh	Washington City Paper	This is the rare, unique entertainment that takes classic action tropes, and turbocharges them.	June 30, 2017
Max Weiss	fresh	Baltimore Magazine	It's a wild ride, a highly caffeinated tour de force filled with great action, lots of deadpan humor, and the kind of prevailing coolness that makes you want to drink espresso, troll vintage record stores, and watch old Steve McQueen films when it's over.	June 30, 2017
Rich Cline	fresh	Contactmusic.com	It's pure candy for the eyes and ears, impeccably staged by writer-director Edgar Wright. And we don't mind much that there's not much more to it than that.	June 30, 2017
Nick Hasted	fresh	The Arts Desk	Some of this film is a classic, and some of it's heartlessly superficial. Wright's obsessive cinephilia fuels both.	June 30, 2017
Todd Jorgenson	fresh	Cinemalogue	Visually inventive and meticulously edited, it's as much a showcase for its characters on four wheels as those with two legs, providing a visceral excitement while toying with clichs.	June 30, 2017
Jeffrey Overstreet	fresh	Looking Closer	Wright calibrates the noises of sirens, squealing brakes, even gunshots to participate in its pop-to-punk playlists, bringing new bursts of inspiration to familiar tracks.	June 30, 2017
Joyce Slaton	fresh	Common Sense Media	Car-centric crime action is stylish, but shallow, violent.	June 30, 2017
Jason Bailey	fresh	Flavorwire	In some ways, it feels like a step backward, considering the maturity and pathos that made his previous picture, 'The World's End,' one of his best. Still, you can't blame a director for wanting to pause his growth and play with his shiny Hollywood toys.	June 30, 2017
Robert Horton	fresh	HeraldNet (Everett, WA)	Fast, violent, and absurd - and the driving is a blast, performed by stunt drivers, not digital effects.	June 30, 2017
Phil Villarreal	fresh	ABC Tucson	The only bad part of Baby Driver is the title.	June 30, 2017
Elias Savada	fresh	Film International	With an intensely supercharged soundtrack driving the frantic editing in this way-cool heist flick, there isn't much fat left to gnaw off the bones by the time the action hits the curb in the final act.	June 30, 2017
Sonny Bunch	fresh	Washington Free Beacon	Well worth seeing on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible.	June 30, 2017

Rohan Naahar	fresh	Hindustan Times	I've never been to the opera, nor have I ever seen a 90-piece orchestra play Beethoven. But I imagine this - the action in this movie - is what it must feel like. Baby Driver is symphonic. It's ecstatic. It's hypnotic. When it soars, it soars.	June 30, 2017
Stephen Silver	fresh	Splice Today	A rollicking action/adventure/comedy/romance/musical that finds a dynamite angle and sticks with it. Here's a film that's fun, and totally unabashed about it.	June 30, 2017
Allan Hunter	fresh	Daily Express (UK)	Baby Driver is often very entertaining but brace yourself for the violence.	June 30, 2017

Rob Carnevale	fresh	Indie London	Edgar Wright has delivered the film of the summer, and one of the best of the year, with Baby Driver, a heist movie that tips its hat to past classics while retaining an energy and style that's steadfastly its own.	June 29, 2017

Joe Morgenstern	fresh	Wall Street Journal	This is not a philosophy of criminology, or a new pathology of antisocial behavior, but it makes for a terrific night at the movies.	June 29, 2017
Steve Davis	fresh	Austin Chronicle	Remember the visceral excitement you felt the first time you saw De Palma's Carrie, Scorsese's Raging Bull or Tarantino's Pulp Fiction...? Baby Driver induces the same reaction.	June 29, 2017

Nigel Andrews	fresh	Financial Times	It's a triumph. It's as lightweight as a souffl, yet as solid as a Ferrari. And it interweaves the inner and outer lives of its hero lightly but with real perception.	June 29, 2017
Candice Frederick	fresh	Reel Talk Online	So fun, oddly romantic, and revitalizes the film soundtrack	June 29, 2017
Peter Travers	fresh	Rolling Stone	Edgar Wright's start to finish sensation is blessed with killer car chases, a star-making turn from Ansel Elgort, the year's best soundtrack and the most fun you'll have at the movies all summer.	June 29, 2017

Geoffrey Macnab	fresh	Independent (UK)	In a summer of yet more synthetic blockbusters, Baby Driver feels entirely original. This is jukebox filmmaking, a wildly energetic movie whose characters behave in line with the songs that fill its soundtrack.	June 28, 2017
Sam Adams	fresh	Slate	In Edgar Wright's Baby Driver, even the machine guns fire in time with the beat.	June 28, 2017
Norman Wilner	fresh	NOW Toronto	If Walter Hill and Jean-Luc Godard had a movie baby, it'd look just like Baby Driver -- but it wouldn't sound half as good.	June 28, 2017
Michael Heaton	rotten	Cleveland Plain Dealer	The music helps distract viewers from the fact that they have no emotional investment in any of these characters or the story itself.	June 28, 2017
Thelma Adams	fresh	Observer	Edgar Wright's crackling crime caper rises to the top of this summer's most entertaining movies. It satisfies my need for speed, baby.	June 28, 2017
Barry Paris	fresh	Pittsburgh Post-Gazette	Lurching between mind-boggling car chases and a cliched young love subplot, the film starts strong and ends weak - both exhilarating and disappointing - but worth seeing for its razzle-dazzle, if mindless, action.	June 28, 2017
Chris Agar	fresh	ScreenRant	Baby Driver is an exhilarating and tense thrill ride that's infectious with its high-octane energy, sheer creativity, and strong performances.	June 28, 2017

Jonathan W. Hickman	fresh	Daily Film Fix	...there is a sequence at the beginning of the film that is pure "Singin' in the Rain" magic. It's a fantastic, absolutely fantastic car chase set perfectly to a pop tune.	June 28, 2017
Joshua Rothkopf	fresh	Time Out	Baby Driver is sweet fantasy, unlike more violent and existential vehicular visions such as Drive or Bullitt. That means its two-bit thieves and criminal masterminds (Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey) are enjoyably cartoonish.	June 28, 2017
Dwight Brown	fresh	National Newspaper Publishers Association	The car chase scenes are the guts of this oddball movie, and they don't disappoint.	June 28, 2017
Martin Roberts	fresh	Fan The Fire	A common criticism of blockbusters these days is a perceived lack of wit or invention -- the sense that big budgets and special effects are often used to paper over fundamental cracks. Baby Driver is an antidote to that feeling.	June 28, 2017
Dana Barbuto	fresh	The Patriot Ledger	Wright builds his script on the back of a killer soundtrack.	June 28, 2017
Matthew Razak	fresh	Flixist.com	Baby Driver should be seen simply because it is such a bold and wonderful idea. That's why I kind of hate to say that it doesn't pull it off fully.	June 28, 2017
Katherine Monk	fresh	Ex-Press.com	Baby Driver winks at our obsession with money and power, without actually winking at all. The film's palpably sincere heart saves it from being smarmy, and Wright's direction keeps the emotional arcs predictable, but pure.	June 28, 2017
Calvin Wilson	fresh	St. Louis Post-Dispatch	It's the kind of action-comedy that makes you want to see it again a second after it's over.	June 28, 2017
Laura Clifford	fresh	Reeling Reviews	Action lovers will be impressed by the film's choreography and live stunts, one driver entering and exiting a narrow alley with 180 degree spins.	June 28, 2017

Frank Swietek	fresh	One Guy's Opinion	Arguably spins out of control in the last act, but overall it makes for a wild ride that provides the sort of juice you'd expect from a top-of-the-line muscle car.	June 28, 2017
Tim Grierson	fresh	Screen International	It's a fun genre mashup that's also rather disposable, offering quick surges of pleasure akin to the cavalcade of tasty pop, rock and R&B songs that litter the soundtrack and provide the film's heartbeat.	June 28, 2017
Eric D. Snider	fresh	EricDSnider.com	If the use of music is a gimmick, it's a remarkably well-executed one, successfully transforming the familiar material into something buoyant and new.	June 28, 2017

Harry Guerin	fresh	RT (Ireland)	Wright takes his foot off the floor here and there in the second half with too much yapping, but otherwise the mix of hardboiled and heartwarming is just right.	June 27, 2017
Ann Hornaday	fresh	Washington Post	As charming as Baby Driver strives to be, the appeal starts to curdle once Wright makes his fetishistic aims clear.	June 27, 2017
Lindsey Bahr	fresh	Associated Press	There's nothing like an epic getaway chase to kick a movie into high gear, and the first five minutes of Baby Driver are pure movie magic.	June 27, 2017
Chris Hewitt	fresh	St. Paul Pioneer Press	Although Baby Driver is technically a heist/chase film, what it's really about is how much in love Wright is with what movies can do.	June 27, 2017
Rafer Guzman	fresh	Newsday	The band Spacemen 3 once titled an album "Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To"... Edgar Wright, a major record-head, might appreciate this comparison: He makes movies out of ideas that are too crazy to make movies out of.	June 27, 2017
Genevieve Koski	fresh	Vox	Baby Driver finds Wright directly in his wheelhouse -- reverently and knowingly deploying genre tropes with visual style and musical panache -- and his enthusiasm is apparent in each and every frame.	June 27, 2017
Adam Graham	rotten	Detroit News	[Baby Driver] is very savvy about pop music and pop culture, and it has a number of thrilling car chase sequences. But those are side items, not main courses, and you can't put dessert before the meal. It winds up driving in circles.	June 27, 2017
Sean P. Means	fresh	Salt Lake Tribune	When Baby Driver gets its engines revved up, it owns the road.	June 27, 2017
Liz Braun	fresh	Toronto Sun	Baby Driver is wild, violent, often very funny and hugely inventive. Wright puts you right in the driver's seat with Baby for spectacular car escapades, but the characters and conversations he creates are just as gripping.	June 27, 2017
Justin Chang	fresh	Los Angeles Times	This is movie craftsmanship and showmanship of a very high order.	June 27, 2017

Brian Lowry	fresh	CNN.com	As sharply executed as a hairpin turn, Baby Driver is a crackling-good ride, one that organically weaves music and humor into a slick showcase for its cast.	June 27, 2017
Abby Olcese	fresh	Sojourners	It's less a movie than a feature-length exercise in editing and sound design. While that makes for a thrilling picture, the overall result is a movie that feels empty.	June 27, 2017
Eric Eisenberg	fresh	CinemaBlend	Bleeding a special cinematic language while being brilliantly unique, it's put together unlike anything you've seen before	June 27, 2017

Steve Persall	fresh	Tampa Bay Times	Wright takes music video literalization to breathtaking heights. Baby Driver doesn't operate from its hero's point of view but rather his point of hearing, essentially the same thing. Wright's ingenious approach literally turns the genre on its ear.	June 27, 2017

Will Leitch	fresh	Paste Magazine	The movie is a foot-tapping, sing-a-long gas, though, like many a summer movie before it, it's best if you don't spend too much time reflecting on its twists and turns, or expect much emotional involvement.	June 25, 2017
Victoria Alexander	fresh	FilmsInReview.com	Edgar Wright put a YA storyline into a heist plot. Unfortunately, sweet Elgort - a criminal - has no dark edges. Baby has 8 out of 10 symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome.	June 25, 2017

Jake Cole	fresh	Slant Magazine	Baby Driver literalizes Edgar Wright's fascination with people's emotional overreliance on pop culture as a cover for arrested development.	June 24, 2017
Armond White	fresh	National Review	[A] curious, coddling delight.	June 23, 2017
Matt Goldberg	fresh	Collider	By using music as a way to tell us about character and emotions, Wright isn't simply doing cool stuff with the soundtrack. He's showing us something that's both beautiful and tragic about his protagonist. He gives us a movie you'll want to put on repeat.	June 23, 2017
Edward Douglas	fresh	New York Daily News	Loads of fun, Baby Driver gives a great ride.	June 23, 2017

Bryan Bishop	fresh	The Verge	Baby Driver is exhilarating, fantastically entertaining, and mildly frustrating, all at the same time. Wright's directorial execution has never been better, and he's able to construct chase sequences that put the Fast and Furious series to shame.	March 17, 2017
Britt Hayes	fresh	ScreenCrush	With Baby Driver, Edgar Wright is officially five-for-five, a rare accomplishment in filmmaking and one that basically guarantees his elevation to all-timer status.	March 16, 2017
Terri Schwartz	fresh	IGN Movies	Even though the story isn't as impactful as its stylized packaging, Wright creates a delightful new film that is sure to satisfy his legions of fans.	March 16, 2017

Eric Kohn	fresh	indieWire	Equal parts slapstick and visceral thrills, but never too far from a reality check.	March 14, 2017

Joe Gross	fresh	Austin American-Statesman	Baby Driver is an ode to those who need a stream of tunes in their heads, everywhere, all the time, and a cinematic high-five to the movies that made Wright the absurdly talented music-n-film dork he is today.	March 13, 2017
Joanna Robinson	fresh	Vanity Fair	A curious blend of heightened comical world building and legitimate tragedy and danger.	March 13, 2017

Matt Donato	fresh	We Got This Covered	Baby Driver proves why we should never doubt Edgar Wright's vision, because few filmmakers can back their ambition with such quality thrills.	March 12, 2017

Peter Debruge	fresh	Variety	Like all Edgar Wright movies, "Baby Driver" is a blast, featuring wall-to-wall music and a surfeit of inspired ideas. But it's also something of a mess ...	March 12, 2017
John DeFore	fresh	Hollywood Reporter	A sweet and speed-crazed crime film you can dance to.	March 12, 2017
Michael Roffman	fresh	Consequence of Sound	This is the La La Land of car chase movies, a jaw-shattering spectacle of sight and sound that sets the bar through the roof for any filmmakers currently cutting their teeth in music videos.	March 12, 2017
William Bibbiani	fresh	CraveOnline	A supercool and ultragroovy heist flick that uses music the way the rest of us use air, and an instant candidate for one of the best car chase movies ever.	March 12, 2017

What kinds of entities will creep in and animate that human clone are stories the horror genre will address in the future, but this is a good start.	November 10, 2019

Mark Goodyear	rotten	Battle Royale With Cheese	Gemini Man is no more and no less than a failed experiment.

October 23, 2019
Hugo Hernndez Valdivia	rotten	Cinexcepcin	The result, thus, is neither rounded in action nor does it take on density in verbal confrontations. In the end, everything indicates that we are facing a failed experiment, both technically and narratively. [Full Review in Spanish]	October 23, 2019

MaryAnn Johanson	rotten	Flick Filosopher	An apparently unfairly maligned 'wicked witch' has to be redeemed again. Anyway, bitches be evil, crazy and traumatized, or sweet dumb personality-free near-morons. You know, for kids!	October 16, 2019
Adam Graham	rotten	Detroit News	Unfortunately, "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil" is the stuff of nightmares.	October 16, 2019
Jeanmarie Tan	fresh	The New Paper (Singapore)	It is always a treat seeing [Michelle] Pfeiffer breaking bad, and when she's going up against someone like [Angelina] Jolie, boy is it good.	October 16, 2019
Fico Cangiano	fresh	CineXpress	The Angelina Jolie vs Michelle Pfeiffer face-off actually elevates this sequel over its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]	October 16, 2019
Christie Cronan	rotten	Raising Whasians	A predictable sequel that underwhelms not only this movie, but the only original Disney live-action concept that I actually enjoyed. It's too bad that this film is also too violent for kids.	October 16, 2019
Sean Collier	rotten	Pittsburgh Magazine	Well this isn't any good.	October 16, 2019
Diedre Johnson	fresh	Black Girl Nerds	With its grandiose set design, bold swaths of color, magical special effects, and award-winning, international cast, the sequel Maleficent: Mistress of Evil tries to rectify the situation.	October 16, 2019
Christopher Lloyd	fresh	The Film Yap	Though a bit silly and ham-handed at times, it's more entertaining than the first one.	October 16, 2019
Jonathan W. Hickman	rotten	Daily Film Fix	"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil" is jumbled nonsense that palely reminds us of what barely made the first film work.	October 16, 2019
Mick LaSalle	rotten	San Francisco Chronicle	The saddest thing about "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil" is that it's not bad, but typical, that this emptiness - this immersion in mass numbification - is the modern style.	October 16, 2019
Katie Walsh	rotten	Tribune News Service	The messages that undergird "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil" are important ones. If only they didn't come wrapped in this goofy, chaotic package.	October 16, 2019
Britany Murphy	fresh	Geeks of Color	Maleficent: Mistress of Evil kept me entertained and dare I say, I may have enjoyed it more than its predecessor.	October 16, 2019
Robert Daniels	fresh	812filmreviews	There's enough magic dust made of sass and a decent amount of political relevance for Maleficent: Mistress of Evil to fancy the imagination	October 16, 2019

J. Don Birnam	fresh	Splash Report	Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer shine as they square off as evil queens in a visually effective but messy and convoluted sequel to the revisiting of the classic story	October 16, 2019
Dan Murrell	rotten	Screen Junkies	Angelina Jolie is great for what little she has to do in the movie. Michelle Pfeiffer has a lot to do, but not much of it is good.	October 16, 2019
Tony Medley	fresh	Tolucan Times	Highlighted by exquisite special effects and the deliciously evil performance of Pfeiffer, this fantasy seems dark and violent for young children but can delight adults	October 16, 2019
Sean P. Means	fresh	Salt Lake Tribune	For older kids, and grown-ups who like their fantasy on a grand scale, this sometimes grim fairy tale is a deliciously dark ride.	October 15, 2019
Tom Beasley	rotten	Flickering Myth	The horns might be longer and more elaborate than ever before, but the ends are blunt.	October 15, 2019
Michael O'Sullivan	rotten	Washington Post	Think twice about taking very young children - or even some susceptible adults - to this at-times shocking, if less than graphic, gloom-and-doom fest. But the worse sin is: It's boring.	October 15, 2019
Kerry Lengel	fresh	Arizona Republic	The cuddly creatures and razzle-dazzle action are enough to make two hours disappear, but it's only Jolie's bat-winged charisma that will rattle on in your memory.	October 15, 2019
Richard Lawson	rotten	Vanity Fair	In its earnest evocation of so many horrors - and of so many hard-won triumphs against poisoned power structures - the movie does have a salient weight to it. I just don't know if this is the right vessel for all that heaviness.	October 15, 2019
Don Kaye	rotten	Den of Geek	As much as Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer squaring off holds appeal, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil falls solidly into the terrain of 'sequel that no one but accountants asked for.'	October 15, 2019
Tomris Laffly	fresh	Time Out	As the nemesis to Angelina Jolie's red-lipped siren, Pfeiffer gives us exactly what we want -- the same hissing Catwoman attitude she heated up for Mother!	October 15, 2019
Joe Lipsett	fresh	Anatomy of a Scream	Despite the five years between films, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a worthy sequel that should appease fans of the first film, particularly its core teen female demograph	October 15, 2019
Caryn James	fresh	BBC.com	Until then, though, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil swoops you along with ease. Like so many Disney films, it is a commercial calculation with a just a splash of magic.	October 15, 2019
Sarah Musnicky	rotten	Nightmarish Conjurings	"It is ultimately a better film than its predecessor, but is weighed down by too many plot points and not enough of Maleficent herself."	October 15, 2019
Johnny Oleksinski	rotten	New York Post	While the first film was, like "Wicked," an alternate view of a classic good-versus-evil tale, its sequel is a one-note, moralistic sledgehammer with no payoff.	October 15, 2019
Karen Han	fresh	Polygon	The film is still, however, leaps and bounds more imaginative than most other recent live-action Disney fare.	October 15, 2019
Fred Topel	rotten	Showbiz Cheat Sheet	Without the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty, the plot becomes too convoluted and Angelina Jolie is not even in the movie for a very large chunk while all of this works itself out.	October 15, 2019
Scott Menzel	fresh	We Live Entertainment	Jolie captures the complexities of this character while also making her relatable and likable.	October 15, 2019
Pat Brown	rotten	Slant Magazine	In transforming folk metaphors into utilitarian attributes of an action hero, Disney exposes the emptiness of their product.	October 15, 2019
Princess Weekes	rotten	The Mary Sue	The big problem with this sequel is that it covers a lot of issues that the it's unable to commit to properly handling, both tonally and structure-wise.	October 15, 2019
Cynthia Vinney	fresh	CBR	Unfortunately, given Disney's recent spate of live-action remakes and unnecessary sequels, it's difficult not to view Mistress of Evil's existence through a cynical lens. That doesn't mean the movie isn't diverting - in fact, it's perfectly watchable.	October 15, 2019
Courtney Howard	rotten	Fresh Fiction	It delivers a dull story that hinges on two women fighting and, worse, it fails to individually give very capable actresses anything resembling Memorable Movie Moments.	October 15, 2019
Jo Berry	fresh	The List	An entire movie of Pfeiffer and Jolie throwing special effects and shade at each other would have made this the most fun fantasy flick of the year.	October 15, 2019
Rosie Knight	fresh	IGN Movies	Impressive visuals and a very watchable cast make this a fun popcorn fantasy flick that's at its best when it leans into its genre roots and aims to create a truly fantastical fairytale world.	October 15, 2019
Chris Hunneysett	fresh	Daily Mirror (UK)	there's always something great to look at, and the smaller woodland creatures are distractingly funny and super cute	October 15, 2019
Amy West	fresh	SciFiNow	How it alters certain aspects of the cartoon won't go down well with diehard Disney fans, but there's something to be said for its boldness and if regarded as a standalone piece, it's much like its protagonist... more good than bad.	October 15, 2019
James Mottram	fresh	South China Morning Post	Ronning does his best to distract from a simple-minded script by littering the frame with computer-generated critters. It's like a visit to a riotous flower show on a particularly sunny day.	October 15, 2019
Sharronda Williams	fresh	Pay Or Wait	Maleficent Mistress of Evil is a solid sequel & a great story for children & adults about intolerance & acceptance. Angelina Jolie is enchanting & Michelle Pfeiffer is bad to the bone as one of the best Disney villains I have seen in quite some time.	October 15, 2019
Kristen Lopez	fresh	Culturess	Mistress of Evil certainly rests comfortably on leading lady Angelina Jolie, but the script takes several gambles in its storytelling to create a rich and lush backstory for Jolie that ends up saving the rest of its fairy-tale narrative.	October 15, 2019
Bob Chipman	fresh	Escapist Magazine	A wickedly-subversive dark fairytale with a high fantasy aesthetic dominated (occasionally in the most suggestive sense possible) by Jolie; flashing a blinding vampire smile of ivory fangs and blood-red lips as the ultimate 21st Century Goth Goddess.	October 15, 2019
Amanda Keats	fresh	HeyUGuys	Visually spectacular fun with a lot of magic but a bit too dark for some little ones	October 15, 2019
Deirdre Molumby	rotten	entertainment.ie	Fans will enjoy returning to the characters but the film just doesn't feel necessary.	October 15, 2019
Monica Castillo	fresh	TheWrap	There are interesting bits within the film that are by themselves entertaining but don't always seem to fit together.	October 15, 2019
Matthew Aguilar	fresh	ComicBook.com	Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a delightful tale of humor, heart, and that trademark Disney magic, and you won't regret returning to this world once more.	October 15, 2019
William Bibbiani	rotten	Bloody Disgusting	A ridiculously written, emotionally insincere motion picture, and although Angelina Jolie is as excellent as ever, the film has no idea what to do with her.	October 15, 2019
Donald Clarke	rotten	Irish Times	[The] messages are packaged in baffling fantasy baloney that fails to achieve the discipline of your average Care Bear movie.	October 15, 2019
Tania Lamb	fresh	Lola Lambchops	When Angelina Jolie gives you the look that only she can, you get those Maleficent chills. Perhaps too violent for small children, I appreciate a different take on a classic tale, especially with all these remakes.	October 15, 2019
Rachel Wagner	rotten	rachelsreviews.net	It's a real bummer because if they had kept the strange tone of the early scenes I could have had a surprise hit.	October 15, 2019
Doug Jamieson	rotten	The Jam Report	While there's plenty of visual mastery at play here, it's simply not enough to warrant this rather tiresome sequel.	October 15, 2019
Hoai-Tran Bui	rotten	Slashfilm	This lofty sequel sacrifices all the storybook whimsy in favor of political intrigue and dark plots that are far too complicated to be wrapped up by a typical Disney happy ending, and end up landing with a thud.	October 15, 2019
Clarisse Loughrey	rotten	Independent (UK)	Maleficent may have offered a sharp, original take on a well-worn story, but its sequel just feels like more fantasy fluff.	October 15, 2019
Kirsten Acuna	fresh	Insider	"It's the hostility and brewing war between Jolie and Pfeiffer's characters and their masterful performances that make the sequel worth a watch."	October 15, 2019
Scott Mendelson	fresh	Forbes	It's better than the first, features strong performances and goes unexpectedly wild in the third act, suggesting the unholy offspring of a union between 'Gargoyles,' 'Avatar' and 'Aquaman.' (Yes, that's a compliment)	October 15, 2019
Brian Truitt	fresh	USA Today	Jolie's magnetism, plus the way she toes the line between being a fairy version of Batman and a menacing mistress of not-quite-evil-but-pretty-close, is why these "Maleficent" movies work.	October 15, 2019
Tim Robey	rotten	Daily Telegraph (UK)	Rnning, who served his Hollywood apprenticeship on the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film, seems to be enslaving himself to franchises which dictate the most anonymous job possible.	October 15, 2019
Jesse Hassenger	rotten	AV Club	Some movies twist; the Maleficent series politely flips on a signal before any turns.	October 15, 2019
Justin Chang	fresh	Los Angeles Times	It's hard not to appreciate the sheer derangement of the plot that Ingrith has concocted, which is so cruel and so elaborate... as to make even the original Maleficent's machinations in "Sleeping Beauty" look tame by comparison.	October 15, 2019
Leah Greenblatt	rotten	Entertainment Weekly	It mostly registers as a series of elaborate fauna-drenched screensavers stretched to fit across two hours of vague Disney myth.	October 15, 2019
Peter Bradshaw	rotten	Guardian	This Maleficent is disappointing, although Jolie certainly sells it hard, as does Fanning, who takes it as seriously as anything else in her career.	October 15, 2019
Eric Kohn	rotten	indieWire	Embrace the imagery and "Mistress of Evil" almost works on its own terms, but anyone grasping for the bigger picture will find that it often evaporates under scrutiny.	October 15, 2019
Brent Hankins	rotten	The Lamplight Review	Maleficent: Mistress of Evil may have the dubious honor of becoming the Disney film with the highest body count, but that's about the only distinction worth bestowing upon it.	October 15, 2019
Todd McCarthy	rotten	Hollywood Reporter	A sequel that feels programmed to within an inch of its life.	October 15, 2019
Peter Debruge	rotten	Variety	The true Disney villains in this case are off screen, sabotaging the studio's canon from within.	October 15, 2019
Eric Eisenberg	rotten	CinemaBlend	Once again there are some interesting concepts floated - like a magical mother vs. mother showdown, and a manipulated war between faeries and humans - but none of the material sticks together.	October 15, 2019
Matt Maytum	rotten	Total Film	An uninspired and unnecessary sequel that won't leave you spellbound. There's neither enough Maleficent or genuine magic to make it worth a revisit.	October 15, 2019
Helen O'Hara	fresh	Empire Magazine	An improvement on the first film, in the end, and an encouraging rallying cry against fear and intolerance, but it's still far too busy and baroque to match its leading lady's elegance.	October 15, 2019
Ian Sandwell	fresh	Digital Spy	Has it been worth the wait? Well, kind of. Freed from the need to redo Sleeping Beauty, it's a superior sequel and often fun, but still not without its flaws.	October 15, 2019
Tessa Smith	fresh	Mama's Geeky	Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is a visually stunning, but also very dark and violent. While it is a heartwarming mother/daughter tale, be cautious when taking young kids.	October 15, 2019
